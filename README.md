# Snort IDS Project

## Objective
The goal of this project was to create a basic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using **Snort** on **Ubuntu**, while simulating various cyberattacks from **Kali Linux**.  
This setup demonstrates how network-based attacks can be detected in real time, helping develop skills in network security monitoring and incident analysis.

### Skills Learned
- Practical experience setting up and configuring Snort in IDS mode.
- Hands-on understanding of detecting real-time network intrusions.
- Knowledge of common network attack methods and detection patterns.
- Improved ability to analyze Snort alerts and logs.
- Strengthened understanding of Linux networking and cybersecurity fundamentals.

### Tools Used
- **Ubuntu OS** (Snort installation and monitoring)
- **Kali Linux** (Attack simulation)
- **Snort** (Network Intrusion Detection System)
- **Nmap** (Network scanning tool for attack simulation)

## Steps

### Step 1: Install Snort on Ubuntu
Install Snort and configure your network interfaces to allow traffic analysis.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install snort 
```

### Step 2: Run Snort in IDS Mode
Run Snort in IDS mode with real-time alerting on the console.
 ```bash
sudo snort -A console -q -u snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i enp0s3
```

### Step 3: Simulate Attacks from Kali Linux
Using Nmap to Simulate a network scan.
```bash
nmap -sS 10.0.2.15
```

### Step 4: Analyze Snort Logs
Once attacks are simulated, check the logs generated by Snort.
